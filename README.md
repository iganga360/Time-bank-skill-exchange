# ‚è≥ Time Bank: Skill Exchange Platform

## Core Concept & Value Proposition

The Time Bank establishes a decentralized system for service exchange, focusing on social capital rather than financial capital.

* **Equal Value:** 1 hour of service = 1 Time Credit, regardless of the skill exchanged.
* **Inclusivity:** Removes financial barriers, providing access to resources for financially excluded populations.

## Problem Statement

The Time Bank is built to directly address four critical socio-economic challenges:

1.  **Rising Unemployment**
2.  **Untapped Skills Wasted**
3.  **Financial Exclusion**
4.  **Social Isolation**

## Impact Metrics (Projected)

| Metric | Target |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Reduction in Income Inequality** | **40%** |
| **Skill Utilization Rate** | **85%** |
| **Community Connections** | **3x Stronger** |

## Future Technology Stack

* **AI-Based Skill Matching:** Intelligently connects user offers with user needs.
* **Blockchain-Secured Credits:** Provides a transparent, immutable, and secure ledger for all time transactions.
